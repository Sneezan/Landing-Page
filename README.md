# Landing-Page - Interstellar Academy
A simple, yet classic and stylish landing page created with HTML and CSS

# The Build and issues 
The landing page is built with HTML and is CSS heavy, omiting the use of JavaScript. 
This project is the first coding project completed outside Technigo Bootcamp.
There is a hero image with text, modern submitform, a hamburger menu without JS that expands in
a circle as well as an FAQ accordion. 

The use of JS could certainly cut down on the use of CSS, but as this is one of the first projects,
the knowledge of JS was at this point non-existant
